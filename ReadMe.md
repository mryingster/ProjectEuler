Project Euler
=============

Description
-----------
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This repository contains a collection of programmatic solutions to some of the problems posed by [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net).

Most of the solutions will be in C or Python.

Dependencies
------------
  * math - Some solutions require the math lib.

Compiling
---------
C based solutions can be compiled directly in emacs using the `M^x compile` command.
